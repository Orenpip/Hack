Software Engineer Intern,"You should join Advanced Simulation Technology inc. (ASTi) if you're a talented programmer who enjoys devising innovative ways to use new technology in product development just as much as you enjoy writing solid code. You don't have be an anonymous code jockey toiling away in a cubicle. You will have the opportunity to play a key role in determining the future of our products, technologies and company.

 

We expect everyone to be comfortable working in small teams of 2-4 people and up to the challenge of managing their own tasks and time without direct supervision. It requires that you be willing to learn new and challenging things, adapt to a changing environment, and accept responsibility for your projects, decisions, and code.

 

Who are we?

 

At ASTi, we make computer hardware and software systems that provide intercom and radio communications, audio and special sound effects, speech recognition and artificial intelligence capabilities, mainly for the simulation and training industry. That's a lot to absorb, so an example may be in order.

Think about someone who is learning to be a commercial airline pilot. The stuff we make helps them learn how to communicate with air traffic control (ATC), other aircraft, and even the copilot sitting next to them. When they climb into a big flight simulator, everything they hear—from the cockpit air whooshes and electronic beeping to the engines roaring during takeoff to all the crew intercom and aviation radio traffic—comes from ASTi systems. We do that for military and civilian training and simulation, and not just for airplanes.

We offer a relaxed atmosphere, excellent compensation and a company-paid retirement plan. We were also included in Washingtonian magazine's ""50 Great Places to Work"" multiple times.

 

More about the job:

 

This is a paid internship in Herndon, VA for a U.S. citizen or permanent resident who has strong problem-solving and analytical skills which they can apply to produce high-quality and well-tested code.

 

You'll get to work with a number of really smart people on a broad range of technologies to develop networked voice communication solutions. We don't expect you to know how to do all this stuff on day one, but we imagine that our new Software Engineer will quickly learn how to:

 

1. Build user-friendly interfaces to hide some of our products' complexity and enhance our users' experience

 

2. Work with signal processing (e.g. compression, noise cancellation, three-dimensional spatialization)

 

3. Work with natural language processing to help bridge the gap between humans and machines (although not to Skynet levels)

 

4. Research and develop solutions using the latest cloud and web-based technologies

 

5. Work alongside our Application Engineers to support our customers and build new products
